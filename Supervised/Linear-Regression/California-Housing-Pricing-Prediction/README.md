# California Housing Pricing Prediction

### Project Overview:

- **Dataset:** California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn
- **Goal:** The goal of the project was to predict the median house value based on various features such as average number of rooms, population density, and average income.
- **Key Steps Taken:** 
    1. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.
    2. Preprocessed the data by scaling the features and splitting it into training and testing sets.
    3. Built a Linear Regression model and evaluated it using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
    4. Created visualizations to assess the model’s prediction accuracy through scatter plots and residuals plots.

### Key Results:

- Achieved a solid R² score, indicating that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in housing prices.
- Gained valuable experience in model evaluation and feature analysis.
